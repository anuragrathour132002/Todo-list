# Todo List | Node.js
This is my first project to practice basic CRUD operations.

## Available Scripts:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Runs all the required npm modules. The node_modules folder is not included here.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.



## Working:
You can do the following things:

1. Create a new task.

2. Find all the created tasks in the to-do list on the home screen.

3. Edit any given task. You can change the task name or you can mark it as completed.
4. Delete a task from the task pool.
